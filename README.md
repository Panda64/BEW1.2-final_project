# Motocross Track Reviews

This site is a final project for my BEW 1.2 class to demonstrate the proficiency in SQL, FlaskWTForms, and Auth techniques.

In short, the purpose for this site is to allow motocross riders to view the tracks in their area and look at reviews for said tracks. Reviews consist of the reviewees riding experience, their rating for the track, their difficulty opinion, and finally, a description.

Locations can also be added to the site as often times, multiple tracks are at the same location.
